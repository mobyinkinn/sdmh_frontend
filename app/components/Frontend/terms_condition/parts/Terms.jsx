        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
        readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of
        using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
        letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it
        look like readable English. Among these, leukaemia is the most common,
        accounting for about 30% of all childhood cancers. Leukaemia can occur
        at any age but it is mostly seen in children aged 2 to 6 years, with 46%
        cases being seen in 2- and 3-year-olds, dropping to 9% by age 19. While
        the disease can’t be prevented, its treatment has evolved over the years
        with strides being made through Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT) and
        CAR T-cell therapy.

        For many patients, bone marrow or stem cell transplants become their
        only chance of recovery. However, with only 0.09% of the population
        registered as potential blood stem cell donors, the gap in donor
        availability is alarming. This shortage is further exacerbated by a lack
        of awareness, diverse gene pool, and widespread misconceptions about the
        treatment which makes a huge gap in demand and supply in India. Our
        efforts focus on educating families about the success rates, costs, and
        support systems associated with BMT and emerging therapies like CAR
        T-cell therapy, which offer new hope for treating complex cases. By
        raising awareness and increasing donor registrations, we aim to close
        the demand-supply gap and improve access to life-saving treatments.” He
        further emphasised the need for doctors, healthcare providers,
        policymakers, and the public to work together in raising awareness,
        dispelling myths, and creating a supportive environment for bone marrow
        transplants and CAR T-cell therapy. “Through these collective efforts,
        we can save countless lives and significantly improve health outcomes
        for thousands of children affected by blood cancer,” said Dr Yadav.
